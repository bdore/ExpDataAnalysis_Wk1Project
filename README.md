# ExpDataAnalysis_Wk1Project
Project for first week of Exploratory Data Analysis Course

- To recreate the plots locally put all .R files in the same directory as "household_power_consumption.txt".
- Set your working directory to the directory containing .R files and .txt file.
- I used the data.table to read the files. It is much faster than other functions.
- I encountered some problems with the legend size and position for plot3. I believe maybe its a bug in rstudio/r/windows. If you are on
a different OS or RStudio version maybe it renders different for you. I'm using 64-bit Windows 7, RStudio Version 0.99.491, R 3.2.3 64-bit.
